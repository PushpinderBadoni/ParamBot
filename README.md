## Description of the Bot:
ParamBot is an Assistant Software Developer. Developers can share a Discord server and use ParamBot as their common assistant. This creates an environment where everyone can see the prompt made by a team member and the response generated by the bot. The bot keeps the record of the context of the chat that allows the other group members to improve the upgrade an already generated code. Moreover, ParamBot will reply to all the questions a programmer can have, be it theoretical or practical.

## Working and API Calls:
ParamBot makes total 3 API calls. Basically, it make 2 api calls to generate 2 different responses and one additional api call to form a better response out of the previous two api call responses. I just used completion API. The details are as follows:
1.	Response 1: Generates response for the user prompt using the gpt-4o-mini model, with max token size limited to 800 and temperature to 0.6 for better accuracy. Set to consider the context of chat.
2.	Response 2: Uses the same model, tokens and messages as Response 1, but has temperature set to 0.9 for a more creative and randomized response. Also set to consider the context of chat.
3.	Response Evaluation: Uses the superior gpt-4o model, with tokens limited to 800 and receives a custom prompt for response evaluation. The temperature is set to 0.5 for a more optimized and consistent response. Evaluates a final response based on Response 1 and Response 2, selects either the better one or a combination of both, but is not allowed to add any kind of additional content from its own side.

## Prompt Engineering:
The prompt for all the API calls has been chosen carefully, extensively tested and modified along the tests. The Response 1 and Response 2 API calls follow the same prompts, focused on generating a response focused on a specific knowledge area, that is, programming and coding. Here, the bot is also commanded to keep the context of the previous conversation to generate a much more suitable response.
The prompt for the Evaluation API call is designed to make the bot an expert evaluator. It is strictly mentioned not to add any additional content but to either select the best of two responses or combine both to generate a better response and present it as a final response.


## Performance:
Based on the response to the prompt. The bot performs really well. It also keeps a good track of the conversation and generates a response accordingly. In the development process, my bot was limited by some restrictions from Discord, such as a character limit on messages sent on Discord’s free version and bot heartbeat, but I handled them well to present it as a more premium version of ParamBot. The only problem I still face is the response generation time. I would work on reducing the time taken by the bot to generate the response. Moreover, I would also focus on improving the chat context handling of the bot, maybe by setting up the level of focus, like the response should be more focused on the last three prompts and their contexts




## Test Cases:
